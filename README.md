Javascript-based SQL(ite3) IDE and tutorial
-------------------------------------------

This is nothing fancy, just a wrapper on sql.js (https://github.com/kripken/sql.js/).

A version of sql.js which works with the tutorial is included as I don't feel like
making a submodule.

There are no other dependencies. It is elegant only in its simplicity.
